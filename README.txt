# Switch Startup Project
Are you often working with solutions that contain multiple startup projects? Then this extension might be interesting for you.  
SwitchStartupProject provides a **toolbar dropdown box** to easily **switch between startup projects.** 
So you don't need to scroll up and down the solution explorer tree anymore just for switching to another startup project!  

For further information, please visit the [SwitchStartupProject project page](https://bitbucket.org/thirteen/switchstartupproject).
